<div class="Description">
  <p>The genocide the people of Palestine are being subjected to by the state of Israel stands as a defining moment for humanity.
    Any life lost is a tragedy, but the current episode of indiscriminate violence against Palestinian civilians with the complicity of the
    Western states doesnâ€™t compare to any other in modern history. We canâ€™t fathom the hardships they are enduring. Our hearts, minds, and souls are with them.</p>
  <p>We have held an extensive dialogue within our community to determine the best course of action. As firm believers in the power of culture as a uniting tool against oppression, we have decided to host a 24-hour livestream in solidarity with Palestine that will include debates, talks and DJ sets.</p>
  <p>Our aim is to echo Palestinian voices, provide a truthful context to the ongoing crisis and share the rich Palestinian culture. We would love to contribute further but the current blockade prevents any donation to go through to the damaged areas and effectively help those in need. In the climate of weaponised misinformation this genocide is being held, we believe informing thoroughly and amplifying the Palestinian narrative is essential.</p>
  <p> Thanks for everyone who is taking part of this stream, all the venues, artists, radios and organisations.</p>
